# The Importance of R in AI

In the generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where data is the only thing plays a vital role in programming languages like R. R, works with its statistical and data analysis tools is used for the development of AI.

### **The R and Deep Learning**

In AI(Artificial Intelligence), R plays a vital role with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras. It helps the AI not to lost in translation, maintaining a perfect balance between understanding and complexity.

# Using Keras with R for Neural Networks

library(keras) model \<- keras_model_sequential() %\>% layer_dense(units = 64, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(1000)) %\>% layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')

# Load necessary libraries

library(rpart) library(rpart.plot)

# Load the Iris dataset

data(iris)

# Explore the first few rows of the dataset

head(iris)

# Split the data into training and testing sets

set.seed(123) indices \<- sample(1:nrow(iris), 0.7 \* nrow(iris)) train_data \<- iris\[indices, \] test_data \<- iris\[-indices, \]

# Build a decision tree model

model \<- rpart(Species \~ ., data = train_data, method = "class")

# Visualize the decision tree

rpart.plot(model, box.palette = "auto")

# Make predictions on the test set

predictions \<- predict(model, test_data, type = "class")

# Evaluate the accuracy of the model

accuracy \<- sum(predictions == test_data\$Species) / nrow(test_data) cat("Accuracy:", round(accuracy \* 100, 2), "%\n")
